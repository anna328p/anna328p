### hi there ðŸ‘‹

i'm anna (she/her or it/its). reach me on discord at `@ap5`.

i want to design and build computing systems, tools, and applications with an emphasis on correctness, reliability, user experience, and maintainability.

my more specific interests and skills include:
- declarative, purely functional programming languages, primarily Nix and Haskell
- DevOps, declarative software deployment, reproducible builds, Nix and NixOS
- mathematical logic, formal verification, type theory
- embedded development and hardware design
- competence in Ruby, systems programming, and the Unix environment

i'm currently:
- designing an operating system and package collection based on the Nix language and package manager, inspired by NixOS
- learning the Rust and Haskell programming languages
- building an Android app that helps users navigate the local public transit system
